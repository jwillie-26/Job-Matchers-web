## About this project
This is a single page application built with React and Redux. This Application consumes the Github Jobs Api. I use the Fetch Api to get jobs data and i store it in the redux store. The retrieved data can be filtered using a Filter stateless component. It is from the redux store that i then supply the data to various components.
