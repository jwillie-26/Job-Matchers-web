# browser-resolve [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-browser-resolve.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/defunctzombie/node-browser-resolve)

node.js resolve algorithm with [browser field](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec) support.

## api

### resolve(id, opts={}, cb)

Resolve a module path and call `cb(err, path [, pkg])`

Options:

* `basedir` - directory to begin resolving from
* `browser` - the 'browser' property to use from package.json (defaults to 'browser')
* `filename` - the calling filename where the `require()` call originated (in the source)
* `modules` - object with module id/name -> path mappings to consult before doing manual resolution (use to provide core modules)
* `packageFilter` - transform the parsed `package.json` contents before looking at the `main` field
* `paths` - `require.paths` array to use if nothing is found on the normal `node_modules` recursive walk

Options supported by [node-resolve](https://github.com/substack/node-resolve#resolveid-opts-cb) can be used.

### resolve.sync(id, opts={})

Same as the async resolve, just uses sync methods.

Options supported by [node-resolve](https://github.com/substack/node-resolve#resolvesyncid-opts) `sync` can be used.

## basic usage

you can resolve files like `require.resolve()`:
``` js
var resolve = require('browser-resolve');
resolve('../', { filename: __filename }, function(err, path) {
    console.log(path);
});
```

```
